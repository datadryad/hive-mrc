What is HIVE?
=============

HIVE is an automatic metadata generation approach that dynamically integrates vocabularies encoded with the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standard.  HIVE is a Linked Open Data (LOD) technology aligning with Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV) activities.  The HIVE approach and technologies promote interoperability among data repositories, libraries, and archives, allowing scholarly works to be easily and quickly indexed across multiple disciplines.

* HIVE R&D, supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation grants #OCI-0940841 and #OCI-0830944, targets HIVE integration in the DataNet Federation Consortium (DFC) and the exploration of HIVE applicability for the DataONE datanet.

*	HIVE is not only an English-language project; through collaboration with teams at the National Library of Spain and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, the HIVE-ES team is working to apply HIVE technologies to Spanish-language vocabularies as well via [HIVE-ES](http://klingon.uc3m.es/hive-es/wiki/index.php/Presentacion) (Espa√±a).

*	Selected HIVE users include the Long Term Ecological Network and United States Geological Survey.

*	Work on the code underlying HIVE is ongoing, and HIVE is committed to making development an open and transparent process.

HIVE was initially funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (grant no. LG-07-08-0120-08), via a partnership involving the Metadata Research Center and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent).
